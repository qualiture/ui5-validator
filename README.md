# SAPUI5 demo - (Multiple) Form Validation

This is a simple example that shows you how to implement a generic validation 
mechanism which allows for validating multiple controls across multiple forms, if necessary.


See [this Plunker demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/VaQHBjDi5ILlzZnQ3hU3?p=preview) for a working demonstration.
